Some small tweaks to chromium source

common:
  - disable some unwanted stuff
  -> just apply the patch

ntp (NewTabPage):
  - disable thumbnails
  - disable top sites
  - disable the indexing of the two
  -> just apply the patch

ui:
  - make the tabs more rectangular-like (works with themes)
  - some minor space adjustments
  -> apply the patch *and* copy the "chrome" folder to the top source folder


No guarantee for anything; use at your own risk.
Kudos to the chromium project, not me.
