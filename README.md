Some small tweaks to chromium source

- common:
  - changes
    - disable google now
    - captive portal detection
  - just apply the patch

- ntp (NewTabPage):
  - changes:
    - disable thumbnails
    - disable top sites
    - disable the indexing of the two
  - just apply the patch

- ui:
  - changes:
    - make the tabs more rectangular-like (works with themes)
    - some minor space adjustments
  - apply the patch *and* copy the "chrome" folder to the top source folder


No guarantee for anything; use at your own risk.
Kudos to the chromium project, not me.
